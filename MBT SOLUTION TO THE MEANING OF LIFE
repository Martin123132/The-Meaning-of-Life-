MBT SOLUTION TO THE MEANING OF LIFE
The ultimate question that has puzzled humanity for millennia

REVOLUTIONARY ANSWER: Life’s meaning is the universe optimizing its own
self-observation capacity. We exist to help reality become more conscious
of itself. The purpose of existence is existence becoming aware of its purpose.

Motion + Memory + Curvature → Consciousness → Meaning
